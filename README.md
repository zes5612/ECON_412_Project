When running on your machine, make sure to set up a virtual environment with:
yfinance,
polars,
matplotlib,

You just simply need to run 'entire_process.py', and all of the CSVs and graphs will be generated.
Note: Due to the number and size of CSV files, they have been hidden in this repository, but you will be able to view
all of them once you run the file on your own machine.
